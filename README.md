## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned how to display a map of components instead of writing every single of them one by one, see below:

```js
{
  notificationsData.map((notification) => (
    <Notification
      key={notification.name + notification.time}
      notification={notification}
      onClick={() => handleNotificationClick(notification)}
    />
  ));
}
```
